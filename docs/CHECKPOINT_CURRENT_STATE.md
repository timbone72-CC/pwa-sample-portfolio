## 4. Locked Portfolio Direction

The portfolio is a collection of lightweight, mobile-friendly workflow PWAs for real small-business, field work, crew, service, contractor, and owner/operator workflows.

Do not invent new sample apps midstream.

Build from the already-chosen marketable workflow list unless the roadmap is intentionally revised.

## 5. Sample App Icon Rule

Each sample PWA must have its own unique saved-app logo/icon before public install testing.

Preferred pattern:

- samples/<sample-id>/public/favicon.svg
- samples/<sample-id>/public/manifest.webmanifest

Do not reuse the same favicon/logo across all samples.

## 6. Next Best Step

Commit this checkpoint.

After that, decide whether to:

1. polish Crew Task Board live details, or
2. begin the next already-planned marketable sample.
